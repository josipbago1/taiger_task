# taiger_task

The whole project is divided into 3 layers, controller, service and repository. For the database I pickled the dictionary where keys indicate different tables and each table is a list of objects. Article is represented by the class Article in the models module. Starting point of the program is main.py where by running there is a simulation of populating the data and fetching the data used by two methods. I didn't use any dependencies so controllers are only the methods. DataAccess class simulates ORM and database with some functionality and is used by repository.

In the method for getting articles by more parameters (indicated that at minimum there needs to be title and author, but I made the function for any number of parameters/fields in the article) I made assumptions. The search could be done by union of conditions or by intersection of conditions (e.g. get all containing title or author specified or get all containing title and author). I made it to be union of conditions.
